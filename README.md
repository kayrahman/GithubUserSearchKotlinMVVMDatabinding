# GithubUserSearchKotlinMVVMDatabinding
Implemented MVVM architecture, databinding, Rx java, Retrofit, Jetpack library and few other third party libraries to make the app as standard as possible. One of the strongest feature of this app is  the application data survives the configuration changes since MVVM architecture is implemented.
